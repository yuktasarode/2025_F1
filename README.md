# üèéÔ∏è F1 Race Result Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict Formula 1 race outcomes using historical data, live telemetry, qualifying performance, and weather forecasts. It simulates the upcoming 2025 Grand Prix races ‚Äî starting with Monaco ‚Äî by predicting race times for each driver and ranking them accordingly.

## üîç Project Highlights

- Combines **FastF1 API**, **2024 race data**, and **2025 qualifying results**
- Integrates **live weather forecasts** via OpenWeather API
- Models include both [**Gradient Boosting**](https://github.com/mar-antaya/2025_f1_predictions)
 and **PyTorch neural networks**
- Prioritizes **low MAE** and **podium stability** across runs
- Predicts full driver race rankings and identifies the expected race winner

## üß† Model Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathers session data and qualifying results using FastF1
   - Fetches race-time weather forecast via OpenWeather

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Aggregates mean sector times
   - Calculates team performance score from constructor points
   - Maps average position change at Monaco
   - Merges clean air pace, qualifying time, and weather into features

3. **Model Training**
   - Baseline: `GradientBoostingRegressor` from scikit-learn
   - Custom: `PyTorch` MLP with dropout, tuning, and evaluation

4. **Prediction & Evaluation**
   - Outputs predicted race times and sorts them for ranking
   - Evaluates performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
